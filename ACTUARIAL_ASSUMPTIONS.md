# Actuarial Assumptions and Disclosures

## Important Notice

**This application provides a simplified actuarial model for pension planning and analysis purposes. It is NOT a full actuarial valuation and should not be used for regulatory reporting, formal actuarial valuations, or legal compliance purposes without review by a credentialed actuary.**

## Model Limitations

This calculator uses simplified assumptions to provide pension benefit and funding estimates. While the mathematical formulas are actuarially sound, the model makes several simplifying assumptions that differ from a comprehensive actuarial valuation.

## Current Model Assumptions

### What This Model Includes

1. **Basic Financial Calculations**
   - Time value of money (present value, future value)
   - Annuity formulas for contribution accumulation
   - 100% funding rule for retirement benefits

2. **Economic Assumptions**
   - Expected investment return rate (configurable, default 7.25%)
   - Expected inflation rate (configurable, default 2.63%)
   - COLA adjustments (compounding or non-compounding)

3. **Benefit Calculations**
   - Actuarial equivalence across pension options
   - COLA increases during retirement
   - Inflation adjustments for buying power analysis
   - Life expectancy-based retirement periods

4. **Funding Methodology**
   - Employee contributions (percentage of base wage)
   - City contributions calculated to achieve 100% funding
   - Funding verification (80-120% acceptable range)

## What a Full Actuarial Valuation Would Include

A comprehensive actuarial valuation performed by a credentialed actuary would incorporate the following additional elements:

### 1. Mortality Tables
- **Current Model**: Uses fixed life expectancies (male: 73, female: 79) with optional adjustment
- **Full Valuation**: Would use published mortality tables such as:
  - RP-2014 (Retirement Plans) or Pub-2010 (Public Plans) mortality tables
  - Age-specific mortality rates (not just average life expectancy)
  - Mortality improvement factors (projected improvements in life expectancy)
  - Separate tables for active employees, retirees, and disabled participants
  - Consideration of plan-specific mortality experience

### 2. Termination/Withdrawal Rates
- **Current Model**: Assumes all employees work until retirement eligibility
- **Full Valuation**: Would include:
  - Age and service-specific termination rates
  - Probability of leaving employment before retirement
  - Vesting provisions and forfeiture assumptions
  - Impact of early terminations on plan funding
  - Turnover rates by employee category

### 3. Disability Assumptions
- **Current Model**: Does not explicitly model disability benefits
- **Full Valuation**: Would include:
  - Disability incidence rates by age and occupation
  - Disability benefit calculations
  - Probability of disability before retirement
  - Impact of disability on plan liabilities

### 4. Salary Scale Assumptions
- **Current Model**: Uses fixed wages or FAC for calculations
- **Full Valuation**: Would include:
  - Annual salary increase assumptions (merit, promotion, inflation)
  - Age and service-based salary progression
  - Salary scale tables
  - Impact of salary growth on final average compensation
  - Consideration of plan-specific salary experience

### 5. Additional Actuarial Elements

A full valuation would also consider:

- **Retirement Age Assumptions**: Age-specific retirement rates (not just eligibility)
- **Early Retirement Factors**: Actuarial reductions for early retirement
- **Deferred Retirement**: Employees who continue working past normal retirement age
- **Marital Status**: Probability of having a spouse at retirement
- **Benefit Commencement**: Timing of benefit payments
- **Plan Demographics**: Detailed analysis of active, retired, and terminated participants
- **Asset Valuation**: Market value, actuarial value, or smoothed asset values
- **Actuarial Cost Methods**: Entry age normal, projected unit credit, frozen initial liability, etc.
- **Amortization Methods**: How unfunded liabilities are paid off over time
- **Experience Studies**: Analysis of actual plan experience vs. assumptions
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Testing impact of assumption changes
- **Stress Testing**: Worst-case scenario analysis

## Regulatory and Compliance Considerations

### This Model Does NOT Provide:
- Actuarial valuation reports for ERISA compliance
- Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) reporting
- Actuarial certifications required by law
- Minimum funding requirements calculations
- Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) reporting
- Actuarial audit support

### Professional Requirements:
- Formal actuarial valuations must be performed by credentialed actuaries
- Actuaries must follow professional standards (ASOPs) from the Actuarial Standards Board
- Valuations must comply with applicable laws and regulations
- Documentation requirements are extensive and specific

## Appropriate Uses of This Model

This calculator is appropriate for:
- **Planning and Analysis**: Understanding pension benefit structures
- **Scenario Testing**: "What-if" analysis of different assumptions
- **Educational Purposes**: Learning about pension calculations
- **Preliminary Estimates**: Rough estimates before formal valuation
- **Policy Discussions**: Exploring impact of plan design changes

## When to Consult a Credentialed Actuary

You should engage a credentialed actuary for:
- Formal actuarial valuations required by law
- Regulatory compliance and reporting
- Legal proceedings or disputes
- Plan design changes requiring actuarial certification
- Funding policy decisions
- Benefit calculations for actual participants
- Any situation requiring actuarial certification or opinion

## Model Accuracy

While this model uses actuarially sound mathematical formulas, the results are estimates based on simplified assumptions. Actual pension costs and benefits may differ significantly due to:
- Actual mortality experience differing from assumptions
- Employee turnover rates
- Salary growth patterns
- Investment returns
- Economic conditions
- Plan-specific experience

## Conclusion

This application provides a valuable tool for understanding pension calculations and exploring different scenarios. However, it is essential to recognize its limitations and consult with credentialed actuaries for formal valuations, regulatory compliance, and critical funding decisions.
